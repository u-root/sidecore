# sidecore

![Sidecore](art/sidecorelogo.png)

Using flattened Docker images from <https://github.com/u-root/sidecore-images>,
**sidecore** lets you run IoT systems as easily as you run a shell script.

## How it works

Building on top of [`cpu`](https://github.com/u-root/cpu), **sidecore** merely
requires your IoT system to run a small daemon in order to use it as a resource.
